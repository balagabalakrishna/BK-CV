    "Software Engineer turned Entrepreneur. I love building things and helping people. Very active on Twitter.",
  summary: ` Full Stack Engineer building fast, functional web experiences with Next.js, TS, Postgres, Framer Motion. Think technical precision meets creative problem-solving.

I craft premium landing pages in my free timeâ€”most of them free because I'm generous like that. Currently working on some secret app, learning new technology because apparently I don't sleep enough.

And for fun? State-level boxer. Gold and Bronze. Bringing that same discipline (and punchline) to code.`,
